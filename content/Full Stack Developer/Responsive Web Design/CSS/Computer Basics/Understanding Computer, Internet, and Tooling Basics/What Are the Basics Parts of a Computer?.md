 Computers are powerful tools used for everything from writing documents to playing games and browsing the web. As a developer, understanding the core components of a computer is essential.

**1. Motherboard**  
The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components. It houses memory, connectors, and serves as the central hub for communication within the computer.

**2. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**  
Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instructions and performs calculations. Its speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz) or megahertz (MHz), determines how quickly it processes data.

**3. RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
RAM is the computer's short-term memory, allowing the CPU to quickly access data. More RAM enables smoother multitasking, but since it’s volatile, data is lost when the power is off.

**4. Storage: HDD vs SSD**

- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):** Uses spinning platters to store data permanently. Offers large storage but is slower.
    
- **Solid State Drive (SSD):** Faster and more compact, SSDs use flash memory, though typically at a higher cost per gigabyte.

**5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)**  
The PSU converts electricity from a wall outlet into usable power for the motherboard, CPU, and other components.

**6. Expansion Cards**  
Expansion cards add extra functionality:

- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Renders visuals.
    
- **Sound Card:** Manages audio output.
    
- **Network Card:** Enables internet connectivity.
    

While computers contain many more parts, these basics form the foundation of any modern system. Understanding them will help you troubleshoot, upgrade, or build your own machine with confidence.
