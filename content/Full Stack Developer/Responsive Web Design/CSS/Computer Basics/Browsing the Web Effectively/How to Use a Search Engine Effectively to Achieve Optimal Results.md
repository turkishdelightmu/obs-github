Searching the internet can feel overwhelming, but with a few simple techniques, you can find exactly what you need.

**Use Boolean Search Syntax**  
Boolean operators help refine your search:

- **Quotes (`" "`):** Search for exact phrases.  
    Example: `"freecodecamp curriculum"`
    
- **Plus (`+`):** Include specific words, even if not next to each other.  
    Example: `+freecodecamp +curriculum`
    
- **Minus (`-`):** Exclude certain terms.  
    Example: `+freecodecamp -curriculum`
    
- **site:** Search within a specific website.  
    Example: `site:freecodecamp.org/news curriculum`  
    Combos like `site:freecodecamp.org/news +python -curriculum` target precise results.
    
**Pro Tips**

- Check your search engine’s documentation—operators may differ.
    
- Combine multiple operators for powerful, customized searches.
    

Mastering these techniques will help you navigate the web smarter and faster.
