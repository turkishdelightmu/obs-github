 Large text and Braille keyboards are designed to assist individuals with visual disabilities. These keyboards provide alternative input methods that improve accessibility and usability for people with low vision or blindness.

### Large Text Keyboards

Large text keyboards, also known as large print keyboards, feature larger letters, numbers, and symbols compared to standard keyboards. This design is beneficial for individuals who struggle to read small text on keys. Most of these keyboards also have enhanced contrast and brightness to improve visibility.

For example, some large print keyboards have yellow keys with bold black letters, numbers, and symbols, making them easier to distinguish for users with low vision. Others have a black background with white print, sometimes featuring backlighting that allows users to adjust brightness according to different lighting conditions.

### Braille Keyboards

While large print keyboards provide visual assistance, Braille keyboards offer a completely tactile experience for individuals with severe vision impairments, including those who are blind. 

Braille is a tactile reading and writing system composed of raised dots arranged in specific patterns to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. Braille keyboards incorporate these patterns, allowing users to identify keys through touch rather than sight. 

For instance, Braille keyboards feature raised dots on the keys, enabling users to locate and distinguish letters, numbers, and symbols by feeling them. Some keyboards even combine both large print and Braille elements, making them useful for individuals with varying degrees of vision impairment or those learning Braille.

### Who Uses Large Text and Braille Keyboards?

Large text and Braille keyboards empower individuals with visual disabilities by providing accessible input methods for computers and mobile devices. They are commonly used by:
- Individuals with low vision who require high-contrast, large-text keys.
- People who are blind and rely on Braille to interact with digital devices.
- Individuals transitioning to Braille literacy.

### The Importance of Assistive Keyboards

These assistive technologies play a crucial role in ensuring digital inclusivity. They allow individuals with visual impairments to access education, employment, and social interactions, fostering independence and participation in the digital world.

By designing and implementing accessible hardware like large text and Braille keyboards, developers and manufacturers contribute to a more inclusive technological landscape where everyone can engage with digital tools seamlessly.
