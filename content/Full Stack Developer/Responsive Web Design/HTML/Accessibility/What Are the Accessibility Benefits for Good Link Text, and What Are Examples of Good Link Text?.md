 **Good link text** improves accessibility by providing clear, descriptive information about where a link leads, benefiting all users—especially those using screen readers or with cognitive disabilities.

### **Benefits of Good Link Text:**  
✅ Helps users quickly understand the link’s purpose.  
✅ Enhances navigation for screen reader users (who rely on link text alone).  
✅ Provides context, reducing confusion for users with cognitive disabilities.  
✅ Improves overall user experience and site usability.

### **Best Practices:**  
- **Be descriptive and concise** (2-5 words is ideal).  
- **Avoid vague phrases** like `"here"`, `"click here"`, or `"more info"`.  
- **Focus on the destination** rather than the action.  
- **Ensure links are visually distinct** (e.g., underlined).  
- **Avoid jargon and unnecessary abbreviations.**  
- **Don’t use identical link texts for different destinations.**  
- **Make links contextually relevant** within surrounding text.
