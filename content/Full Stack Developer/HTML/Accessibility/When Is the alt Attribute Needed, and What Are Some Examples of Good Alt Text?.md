 The **alt** attribute provides a text description of images, making websites accessible for users with visual disabilities and improving search engine understanding. It also serves as fallback text when images fail to load.

### **When to Use alt Text:**  
- **Informative Images:** Include descriptive alt text to convey essential information.  
- **Linked Images:** Describe the action or destination, not just the image.  
- **Decorative Images:** Use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) to ensure screen readers skip them.  

### **Good vs. Bad alt Text:**  
- **Bad Example:** `"A cute puppy"` – too vague.  
- **Good Example:** `"A black and white puppy with an orange collar lies on its belly in the sand, looking off to the side. A bright orange ball rests near its front paws."` – detailed and relevant.  

- **Bad Example:** `"Resort"` – lacks context.  
- **Good Example:** `"Tropical resort featuring a swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and bungalows."` – includes key details.  

- **For Links:**  
  - Bad: `"Right arrow."`  
  - Good: `"Go to next page."` – describes the link’s purpose.  

### **Best Practices:**  
✅ Be concise but informative.  
✅ Focus on essential details, not every visual element.  
✅ Avoid starting with "image of" or "picture of."  
✅ End with a period for consistency.  
✅ Test with screen readers before launching the site.  

Writing effective **alt text** ensures an inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly web experience.
