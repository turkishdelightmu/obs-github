Accessibility is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of digital content. Ensuring that your digital content meets accessibility standards is essential for providing an inclusive experience for all users.

An accessibility auditing tool is an application that helps improve the accessibility of digital content by identifying issues through automated testing. This content includes websites, web applications, and mobile apps. However, it is important to note that while automated accessibility tools play a significant role, they typically detect only about a third of all possible accessibility issues. Therefore, relying solely on them is not enough—manual testing, preferably by individuals with disabilities, is always required to ensure the highest level of accessibility.

## Free Accessibility Auditing Tools

Here are some free tools that can help improve the accessibility of your digital content:

### Google Lighthouse
Google Lighthouse is a widely used web metric checker that can be accessed directly within Chrome DevTools or online. It allows users to analyze not only live websites but also locally developed ones. Lighthouse evaluates various metrics, including accessibility, SEO, best practices, and performance.

To use Lighthouse:
1. Open Chrome DevTools by pressing **F12**.
2. Switch to the **Lighthouse** tab.
3. Select the metrics you want to check.
4. Choose the device you want to test on.
5. Click the **Analyze page load** button.

After the check is complete, Lighthouse provides an accessibility score along with a list of issues that need to be fixed. If you require more reliable metrics, consider using the web version; however, note that it does not support testing local websites.

### WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
WAVE is another reliable accessibility checker available as a Chrome extension or an online tool. Simply enter the URL of your website, and WAVE generates a comprehensive accessibility report. This report includes details on implemented accessibility features, ARIA attributes, and contrast issues.

### IBM Equal Accessibility Checker
The IBM Equal Accessibility Checker is a robust tool designed to improve digital content accessibility. It scans websites for accessibility issues and generates a detailed report. You can use it as a Chrome extension or a Firefox add-on.

To use the IBM Equal Accessibility Checker in Chrome:
6. Download the extension from the **Chrome Web Store**.
7. Open Chrome DevTools by pressing **F12**.
8. Select the **Accessibility Checker** tab in the Elements panel.
9. Click the **Scan** button to start the audit.

The tool generates a report, which can be exported as a spreadsheet or an HTML file by clicking the **Export XLS** button.

## Final Thoughts
While these automated tools assist in making digital content more accessible, achieving a perfect score on any of them does not guarantee full accessibility. The range of issues these tools test for is limited, making manual testing an essential step in ensuring a truly inclusive experience for all users.

By leveraging both automated and manual testing, you can significantly enhance the accessibility of your digital content, making it more inclusive for everyone.
