 When you begin working with HTML and CSS, you may notice that your webpage already has some basic styling—even before you write any CSS. These are called _default browser styles_ or _user-agent styles_, and they help ensure that HTML elements display in a readable format across different browsers.

However, these styles can differ slightly between browsers, which makes understanding them important for consistent web design.

Here are a few examples:

- **Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**: These come with preset font sizes and weights, with `<h1>` typically the largest and boldest.
    
- **Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`)**: Rendered as a thin line with spacing above and below to divide sections.
    
- **Blockquote (`<blockquote>`)**: Often indented and sometimes italicized to indicate quoted content.
    
- **Anchor (`<a>`)**: Styled with blue text and underlining to indicate clickable links.
    
- **Lists (`<ol>`, `<ul>`)**: Include default indentation and display either numbers or bullet points for list items.
    

Understanding these styles lays the foundation for customising your site’s design. In future lessons, you'll learn how to override or reset them using CSS.
