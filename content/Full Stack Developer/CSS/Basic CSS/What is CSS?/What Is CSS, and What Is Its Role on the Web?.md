CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental part of web development that controls how websites look. While HTML provides the structure of a web page, CSS adds the style—think layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.

By separating content from design, CSS makes websites more flexible and easier to maintain. It allows developers to apply consistent styling across multiple pages using external stylesheets and supports responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

In short, CSS transforms plain HTML into visually appealing, user-friendly web experiences—bringing the web to life.
