Managing your files doesn’t have to be complicated. Both Mac and Windows computers come equipped with powerful, built-in file management applications to help you stay organized.

On **Windows**, the go-to tool is **File Explorer**. You can open it from the Start menu or by pressing the Windows logo key. It lets you browse, search, and manage files easily. To move items, select the file, choose “Cut,” navigate to the new location, and “Paste.” Want quick access to a folder? Just right-click and select “Pin.”

On **Mac**, **Finder** is your file management hub. Access it from the Dock, and use the sidebar to navigate favorite folders. You can add colorful **tags** by right-clicking a file and selecting “Tags…”, making it easier to find later. For more advanced organization, use **Smart Folders** to automatically sort files by criteria like type or date.

Whether you're on Windows or Mac, these tools offer simple, effective ways to keep your digital workspace tidy and efficient.
