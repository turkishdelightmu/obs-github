When building web applications, clear and consistent file naming is key to keeping your project organized and maintainable.

**Use descriptive names:**  
Avoid vague names like `index1234.html`. Instead, go for something meaningful like `about-us.html`, which clearly indicates the file's content.

**Stick to lowercase and hyphens:**  
Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words—**not** spaces or underscores. For example: `contact-form.html`.

**Avoid special characters:**  
File names like `file-1!@.html` are confusing and should be avoided. Stick with letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

**Understand `index.html`:**  
This is the default homepage of most websites. Browsers automatically load `index.html` when visiting a domain.

**Follow team conventions:**  
If you're working on a team, always follow the established file naming standards and consult the style guide.

Using clear, simple, and consistent file names makes your web development process smoother and your code easier to maintain.
