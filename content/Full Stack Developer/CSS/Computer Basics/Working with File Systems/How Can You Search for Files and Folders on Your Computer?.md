Quickly finding files is essential for productivity. Here's how to search on both Windows and macOS.

### **On Windows**

- **Taskbar Search:** Type a file name or keyword into the Taskbar. Results appear from your PC and OneDrive. Use tabs like **Documents** or **Apps** to filter.
    
- **File Explorer Search:** In the top-right corner of any Explorer window, type your search. You can:
    
    - Search from **Home** for broad results.
        
    - Search from a **specific folder** for targeted results.
        
    - Search from **This PC** for a deep, system-wide search.

### **On macOS**

- **Spotlight Search:** Press **Command + Spacebar** or click the magnifying glass in the menu bar. Type your file name and view results by category (e.g., documents, photos, folders).
    
- **Finder > Recents:** Open **Finder**, then click **Recents** in the sidebar to view recently accessed files.

Using these tools on Windows and macOS helps you find what you need fast—saving time and improving workflow.
