Though they work together, **web browsers**, **websites**, and **search engines** serve distinct roles on the internet:

- **Web Browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) are applications that let you access and view websites. They interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render pages and provide features like bookmarks, extensions, and privacy tools.
    
- **Websites** are collections of web pages grouped under a domain name (like _freecodecamp.org_). They include text, media, and interactive elements and can be static or dynamic depending on how content is delivered.
    
- **Search Engines** (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) help users find websites by indexing and ranking web content using crawlers and algorithms. They display search results based on relevance, authority, and user intent.
    

In short:  

**Browsers** let you **visit websites**, and **search engines** help you **find them**. Understanding how they work together is essential for navigating the web efficiently.
