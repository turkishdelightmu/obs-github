An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that gives you access to the internet. ISPs come in three main tiers:

- **Tier 1**: Global giants with their own extensive infrastructure, handling most of their traffic independently.
    
- **Tier 2**: National-level providers that may lease access from Tier 1 but maintain strong networks.
    
- **Tier 3**: Local ISPs that serve specific regions and depend on larger tiers for infrastructure.
    

ISPs also offer various connection types:

- **Fiber Optic**: Fastest option, using light to transfer data via glass/plastic fibers.
    
- **Cable**: Uses cable TV lines; widely available.
    
- **DSL**: Runs over telephone lines; slower but accessible in many areas.
    
- **Dial-Up**: Outdated and slow, also uses phone lines but ties up the line.
    
- **Satellite**: Connects via orbiting satellites, ideal for remote areas.
    
- **5G Home Internet**: Uses mobile networks and towers for wireless access.
    

Knowing these options can help you choose the best ISP and connection type for your needs.
