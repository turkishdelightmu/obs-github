Many of us spend hours each day using a keyboard and mouse—whether for work, gaming, or browsing the web. But without proper habits, this routine can lead to long-term health issues.

Here are key tips for working with these devices in a healthier way:

- **Loosen your grip**: Avoid gripping the mouse too tightly, especially during intense tasks. A relaxed hand reduces strain on your fingers and wrist.
    
- **Invest in ergonomics**: An ergonomic keyboard and mouse can help maintain a natural hand position, reducing stress on joints and muscles.
    
- **Align your setup**: Keep your mouse at the same height as your keyboard to prevent unnecessary wrist and arm strain.
    
- **Watch your posture**: Sit upright and avoid slouching. Keep your wrists in a neutral position to prevent repetitive strain injuries.
    
- **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Reduce excessive typing by learning shortcuts for your operating system, browser, or coding tools.
    

Practicing these habits consistently will help protect your health as you take on future projects at the computer.
